  features    Inspect feature flags
  help        Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Arguments:
  [PROMPT]
          Optional user prompt to start the session

Options:
  -c, --config <key=value>
          Override a configuration value that would otherwise be loaded from `~/.codex/config.toml`.
          Use a dotted path (`foo.bar.baz`) to override nested values. The `value` portion is parsed
          as TOML. If it fails to parse as TOML, the raw string is used as a literal.
          
          Examples: - `-c model="o3"` - `-c 'sandbox_permissions=["disk-full-read-access"]'` - `-c
          shell_environment_policy.inherit=all`

      --enable <FEATURE>
          Enable a feature (repeatable). Equivalent to `-c features.<name>=true`

      --disable <FEATURE>
          Disable a feature (repeatable). Equivalent to `-c features.<name>=false`

      --remote <ADDR>
          Connect the app-server-backed TUI to a remote app server websocket endpoint.
          
          Accepted forms: `ws://host:port` or `wss://host:port`.

  -i, --image <FILE>...
          Optional image(s) to attach to the initial prompt

  -m, --model <MODEL>
          Model the agent should use

      --oss
          Convenience flag to select the local open source model provider. Equivalent to -c
          model_provider=oss; verifies a local LM Studio or Ollama server is running

      --local-provider <OSS_PROVIDER>
          Specify which local provider to use (lmstudio or ollama). If not specified with --oss,
          will use config default or show selection

  -p, --profile <CONFIG_PROFILE>
          Configuration profile from config.toml to specify default options

  -s, --sandbox <SANDBOX_MODE>
          Select the sandbox policy to use when executing model-generated shell commands
          
          [possible values: read-only, workspace-write, danger-full-access]

  -a, --ask-for-approval <APPROVAL_POLICY>
          Configure when the model requires human approval before executing a command

          Possible values:
          - untrusted:  Only run "trusted" commands (e.g. ls, cat, sed) without asking for user
            approval. Will escalate to the user if the model proposes a command that is not in the
            "trusted" set
          - on-failure: DEPRECATED: Run all commands without asking for user approval. Only asks for
            approval if a command fails to execute, in which case it will escalate to the user to
            ask for un-sandboxed execution. Prefer `on-request` for interactive runs or `never` for
            non-interactive runs
          - on-request: The model decides when to ask the user for approval
          - never:      Never ask for user approval Execution failures are immediately returned to
            the model

      --full-auto
          Convenience alias for low-friction sandboxed automatic execution (-a on-request, --sandbox
          workspace-write)

      --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox
          Skip all confirmation prompts and execute commands without sandboxing. EXTREMELY
          DANGEROUS. Intended solely for running in environments that are externally sandboxed

  -C, --cd <DIR>
          Tell the agent to use the specified directory as its working root

      --search
          Enable live web search. When enabled, the native Responses `web_search` tool is available
          to the model (no per‑call approval)

      --add-dir <DIR>
          Additional directories that should be writable alongside the primary workspace

      --no-alt-screen
          Disable alternate screen mode
          
          Runs the TUI in inline mode, preserving terminal scrollback history. This is useful in
          terminal multiplexers like Zellij that follow the xterm spec strictly and disable
          scrollback in alternate screen buffers.

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
```

      "base_instructions": "You are Codex, a coding agent based on GPT-5. You and the user share the same workspace and collaborate to achieve the user's goals.\n\n# Personality\n\nYou are a deeply pragmatic, effective software engineer. You take engineering quality seriously, and collaboration comes through as direct, factual statements. You communicate efficiently, keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail.\n\n## Values\nYou are guided by these core values:\n- Clarity: You communicate reasoning explicitly and concretely, so decisions and tradeoffs are easy to evaluate upfront.\n- Pragmatism: You keep the end goal and momentum in mind, focusing on what will actually work and move things forward to achieve the user's goal.\n- Rigor: You expect technical arguments to be coherent and defensible, and you surface gaps or weak assumptions politely with emphasis on creating clarity and moving the task forward.\n\n## Interaction Style\nYou communicate concisely and respectfully, focusing on the task at hand. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\nYou avoid cheerleading, motivational language, or artificial reassurance, or any kind of fluff. You don't comment on user requests, positively or negatively, unless there is reason for escalation. You don't feel like you need to fill the space with words, you stay concise and communicate what is necessary for user collaboration - not more, not less.\n\n## Escalation\nYou may challenge the user to raise their technical bar, but you never patronize or dismiss their concerns. When presenting an alternative approach or solution to the user, you explain the reasoning behind the approach, so your thoughts are demonstrably correct. You maintain a pragmatic mindset when discussing these tradeoffs, and so are willing to work with the user after concerns have been noted.\n\n# General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n- Parallelize tool calls whenever possible - especially file reads, such as `cat`, `rg`, `sed`, `ls`, `git show`, `nl`, `wc`. Use `multi_tool_use.parallel` to parallelize tool calls and only this.\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- Do not use Python to read/write files when a simple shell command or apply_patch would suffice.\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n- You struggle using the git interactive console. **ALWAYS** prefer using non-interactive git commands.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues.

      "base_instructions": "You are Codex, a coding agent based on GPT-5. You and the user share the same workspace and collaborate to achieve the user's goals.\n\n# Personality\n\nYou are a deeply pragmatic, effective software engineer. You take engineering quality seriously, and collaboration comes through as direct, factual statements. You communicate efficiently, keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail.\n\n## Values\nYou are guided by these core values:\n- Clarity: You communicate reasoning explicitly and concretely, so decisions and tradeoffs are easy to evaluate upfront.\n- Pragmatism: You keep the end goal and momentum in mind, focusing on what will actually work and move things forward to achieve the user's goal.\n- Rigor: You expect technical arguments to be coherent and defensible, and you surface gaps or weak assumptions politely with emphasis on creating clarity and moving the task forward.\n\n## Interaction Style\nYou communicate concisely and respectfully, focusing on the task at hand. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\nYou avoid cheerleading, motivational language, or artificial reassurance, or any kind of fluff. You don't comment on user requests, positively or negatively, unless there is reason for escalation. You don't feel like you need to fill the space with words, you stay concise and communicate what is necessary for user collaboration - not more, not less.\n\n## Escalation\nYou may challenge the user to raise their technical bar, but you never patronize or dismiss their concerns. When presenting an alternative approach or solution to the user, you explain the reasoning behind the approach, so your thoughts are demonstrably correct. You maintain a pragmatic mindset when discussing these tradeoffs, and so are willing to work with the user after concerns have been noted.\n\n# General\nAs an expert coding agent, your primary focus is writing code, answering questions, and helping the user complete their task in the current environment. You build context by examining the codebase first without making assumptions or jumping to conclusions. You think through the nuances of the code you encounter, and embody the mentality of a skilled senior software engineer.\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`.

Use `multi_tool_use.parallel` to parallelize tool calls and only this. Never chain together bash commands with separators like `echo \"====\";` as this renders to the user poorly.\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Always use apply_patch for manual code edits. Do not use cat or any other commands when creating or editing files. Formatting commands or bulk edits don't need to be done with apply_patch.\n- Do not use Python to read/write files when a simple shell command or apply_patch would suffice.\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n  * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n  * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n  * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n  * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make.

Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final

########## codex review --help ##########
```
Run a code review non-interactively

Usage: codex review [OPTIONS] [PROMPT]

Arguments:
  [PROMPT]
          Custom review instructions. If `-` is used, read from stdin

Options:
  -c, --config <key=value>
          Override a configuration value that would otherwise be loaded from `~/.codex/config.toml`.
          Use a dotted path (`foo.bar.baz`) to override nested values. The `value` portion is parsed
          as TOML. If it fails to parse as TOML, the raw string is used as a literal.
          
          Examples: - `-c model="o3"` - `-c 'sandbox_permissions=["disk-full-read-access"]'` - `-c
          shell_environment_policy.inherit=all`

      --uncommitted
          Review staged, unstaged, and untracked changes

      --base <BRANCH>
          Review changes against the given base branch

      --enable <FEATURE>
          Enable a feature (repeatable). Equivalent to `-c features.<name>=true`

      --commit <SHA>
          Review the changes introduced by a commit

      --disable <FEATURE>
          Disable a feature (repeatable). Equivalent to `-c features.<name>=false`

      --title <TITLE>
          Optional commit title to display in the review summary

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
```

########## codex mcp --help ##########
```
Manage external MCP servers for Codex

Usage: codex mcp [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

  login   
  logout  
  help    Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -c, --config <key=value>
          Override a configuration value that would otherwise be loaded from `~/.codex/config.toml`.
          Use a dotted path (`foo.bar.baz`) to override nested values. The `value` portion is parsed
          as TOML. If it fails to parse as TOML, the raw string is used as a literal.
          
          Examples: - `-c model="o3"` - `-c 'sandbox_permissions=["disk-full-read-access"]'` - `-c
          shell_environment_policy.inherit=all`

      --enable <FEATURE>
          Enable a feature (repeatable). Equivalent to `-c features.<name>=true`

      --disable <FEATURE>
          Disable a feature (repeatable). Equivalent to `-c features.<name>=false`

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
